## 📌 Overview

The **AI Database Intelligence Agent** is a full-stack React application powered by AI that analyzes relational databases and surfaces insights automatically. It is built around the **Olist Brazilian E-Commerce Dataset** — a real-world schema with 9 interlinked tables, 100K+ orders, and mixed data types including timestamps, floats, text reviews, and geospatial coordinates.

The agent goes beyond basic schema visualization. It interprets your database like a senior data engineer — detecting anomalies, grading table health, explaining SQL, tracing data lineage, and generating plain-English data dictionaries on demand.

Open the artifact directly in your browser — no installation needed.

### Option 2: Run Locally

**Prerequisites**
- Node.js 18+
- An AI API key (see setup step 4)

**Steps**

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-database-intelligence-agent.git
cd ai-database-intelligence-agent

# 2. Create a Vite + React project
npm create vite@latest . -- --template react
npm install

# 3. Copy the component
cp db-intelligence-agent-v2.jsx src/App.jsx

# 4. Add your API key
# In src/App.jsx, find the askAI function and add headers: -->
<!-- ```

```js
headers: {
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
  "x-api-key": "YOUR_AI_API_KEY",
  "ai-version": "2023-06-01",
  "ai-dangerous-direct-browser-access": "true",
},
```

```bash

```

The entire agent lives in a single `App.jsx` file, organized into:
- **Static data layer** — schema definitions, relationships, anomaly rules, SQL templates
- **AI layer** — `askAI()` function wrapping the AI API
- **Component layer** — reusable UI components (Badge, ProgressBar, AIBox, ERDiagram, etc.)
- **Tab views** — 10 fully independent feature tabs
